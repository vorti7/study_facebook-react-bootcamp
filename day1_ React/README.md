## Start React !
### 1. **CRA(Create-React-App)**
```bash
$ npx create-react-app my-app 
```
>Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

### 2. **Next.js**
```bash
$ npm install next react react-dom
$ npm init 
```
>Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It includes styling and routing solutions out of the box, and assumes that you’re using Node.js as the server environment.


### 3. **Self(eject from CRA)**
```bash
$ npm run eject
```
### 4. **Gatsby**
>Gatsby is the best way to create static websites with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs pre-rendered HTML and CSS to guarantee the fastest load time.
